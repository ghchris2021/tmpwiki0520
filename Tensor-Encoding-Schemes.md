There isn't really a real writeup of all the mapping, but this should hopefully be a good central starting point if any maintainers needs some understanding of when each feature was added and the general specs of each. Updating it with more accurate information is greatly appreciated

## Tensor Naming Scheme

This is not definitive, but is helpful when reading sourcecode or console output to understand what each means typically.

- `<Encoding>_<Variants>`
  - `<Encoding>` : This defines the most common encoding of individual weights in the model
	- Floating Point Formats:
	  - `BF16`: [16-bit bfloat16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bfloat16_floating-point_format) [Google Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Brain) truncated form of 32-bit IEEE 754 (1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 7 fractional bits)
	  - `F64`: [64-bit IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format) floats per weight (1 sign bit, 11 exponent bits, 52 fractional bits)
	  - `F32`: [32-bit IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-precision_floating-point_format) floats per weight (1 sign bit, 8 exponent bits, 23 fractional bits)
	  - `F16`: [16-bit IEEE 754](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-precision_floating-point_format) floats per weight (1 sign bit, 5 exponent bits, 10 fractional bits)
	- Integer formats:
	  - `I<X>`: X bits per weight, where `X` could be `4` (for 4 bits) or `8` (for 8 bits) etc...
	- Quantized formats:
	  - `Q<X>`: X bits per weight, where `X` could be `4` (for 4 bits) or `8` (for 8 bits) etc...
	  - `KQ<X>` (or `Q<X>_K`) : k-quant based models. X bits per weight, where `X` could be `4` (for 4 bits) or `8` (for 8 bits) etc...
	  - `IQ<X>`: i-quant based models. X bits per weight, where `X` could be `4` (for 4 bits) or `8` (for 8 bits) etc...
  - `<Variants>`: This represents different strategies of packing quantized weights into a gguf file. This is because we may want a mix of different bit sizes for weights of varying importance, or we may be encoding a general offset to a block or super-block. This may be omitted if trivial or initial attempt, refer to encoding scheme name table for details.
